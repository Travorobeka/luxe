# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to simplify and standardize the typography system across the Shopify theme by consolidating the current complex heading structure into a streamlined three-tier system: main heading, sub-heading, and body text. This will improve consistency, maintainability, and user experience across all theme sections, templates, and snippets.

## Requirements

2. WHEN documenting current usage THEN the system SHALL catalog the different heading styles and their purposes
3. WHEN reviewing global settings THEN the system SHALL identify existing typography configuration options in theme settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a theme developer, I want to establish a simplified three-tier heading system, so that typography is consistent and maintainable across the entire theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN implementing the system THEN the system SHALL ensure proper semantic HTML structure is maintained

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a theme developer, I want to update all sections to use the new heading system, so that section typography is consistent and follows the simplified structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating sections THEN the system SHALL replace existing heading elements with the new three-tier system
2. WHEN modifying section files THEN the system SHALL maintain existing functionality while improving typography consistency
3. WHEN implementing changes THEN the system SHALL ensure all section headings follow the new standardized approach

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a theme developer, I want to update all snippets to use the new heading system, so that reusable components maintain typography consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating snippets THEN the system SHALL replace existing heading elements with the new three-tier system
2. WHEN modifying snippet files THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with sections that use these snippets
3. WHEN implementing changes THEN the system SHALL maintain the reusable nature of snippet components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a theme developer, I want to update all templates to use the new heading system, so that page-level typography is consistent across the entire theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating templates THEN the system SHALL replace existing heading elements with the new three-tier system
2. WHEN modifying template files THEN the system SHALL ensure proper page structure and SEO considerations are maintained
3. WHEN implementing changes THEN the system SHALL verify that all template types (product, collection, page, etc.) follow the new system

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a theme user, I want the typography changes to be seamless and maintain visual hierarchy, so that the user experience remains consistent or improves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the system SHALL display proper visual hierarchy with the new heading system
2. WHEN navigating the site THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent typography across all pages and sections
3. WHEN the changes are implemented THEN the system SHALL ensure no broken layouts or styling issues occur
